The
[Relay](https://scarzebra.com/docs/nodejs/packages/@scarzebra/relay/)
is a server designed to relay all network communications from one
[Network Endpoint](https://scarzebra.com/docs/nodejs/packages/@scarzebra/network-endpoint/)
another
[Network Endpoint](https://scarzebra.com/docs/nodejs/packages/@scarzebra/network-endpoint/)
without requiring either endpoint to have any ports forwarded.

The
[Relay](https://scarzebra.com/docs/nodejs/packages/@scarzebra/relay)
also works from behind NATs.
